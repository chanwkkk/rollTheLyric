Use Node's readFile API and setTimeOut to write a small program to imitate lyric rolling in music app.

Usage: 

1. Fork the repo and cd into the directory. 
2. Find a lrc file that has time format like: "[mm:ss:ms]"
3. Copy the lrc file you found to the lyric.txt file
4. In command line, run "node rolling.js"
5. Then you should see lyric logged out to the console exactly the time it is set in the lrc file.
